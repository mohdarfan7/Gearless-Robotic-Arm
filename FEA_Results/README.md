# Finite Element Analysis Results

This directory contains ANSYS simulation results and analysis files for the Gearless Robotic Arm project.

## Overview

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was performed to validate the structural integrity and optimize the design of the gearless robotic arm. The simulations helped identify stress concentrations, evaluate deformation under various loads, and compare performance with traditional geared designs.

## Key Findings

- 30% reduction in stress concentration compared to traditional designs
- Maximum stress remained below material yield strength with a safety factor of 1.8
- Critical areas identified and reinforced in the final design
- Weight reduction of 25% achieved while maintaining structural integrity
