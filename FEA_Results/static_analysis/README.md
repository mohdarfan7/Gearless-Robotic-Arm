# Static Analysis Results

This directory contains static load FEA simulation results.

## Simulations Included

- `full_extension_analysis.png` - Stress analysis at full arm extension
- `base_rotation_analysis.png` - Stress analysis during base rotation
- `maximum_load_analysis.png` - Structural integrity under maximum rated load
- `yield_safety_factor.png` - Safety factor visualization across the structure

## Summary of Findings

The static analysis confirms that the gearless design distributes stresses more evenly than traditional geared alternatives. All components maintain a minimum safety factor of 1.8 under maximum rated load conditions, exceeding the design requirement of 1.5.

Key stress concentration areas were identified at:
1. Elbow joint connection
2. Base rotation mechanism
3. Wrist actuator mounting points

These areas were subsequently reinforced in the design iterations shown in the `/optimization` directory.
