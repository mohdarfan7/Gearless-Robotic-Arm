# Dynamic Analysis Results

This directory contains results from dynamic simulations of the gearless robotic arm.

## Simulations Included

- `frequency_response.png` - Natural frequency analysis
- `vibration_damping.png` - Vibration damping characteristics
- `acceleration_effects.png` - Stress distribution during rapid acceleration
- `fatigue_analysis.png` - Estimated fatigue life under cyclic loading

## Key Findings

- **Natural Frequencies**: The first natural frequency occurs at 28.7 Hz, well above the operating frequency range of 0-10 Hz
- **Vibration Damping**: The gearless design shows 45% faster vibration damping compared to geared alternatives
- **Acceleration Performance**: Maximum stress during emergency stop (2g deceleration) remains within 65% of yield strength
- **Fatigue Life**: Estimated cycle life exceeds 1 million cycles at rated load

## Conclusions

The dynamic analysis confirms that the gearless design provides excellent stability during operation with minimal vibration. The removal of gearing not only reduces weight but significantly improves the dynamic response characteristics of the arm.
