# Design Optimization

This directory contains the results of iterative design optimization based on FEA results.

## Optimization Process

The design went through 4 major iterations:
1. Initial concept with traditional joint design
2. First gearless prototype (weight reduction of 15%)
3. Structural optimization based on FEA (stress reduction of 22%)
4. Final design with 30% stress reduction and 25% weight reduction

## Critical Optimizations

- **Elbow Joint Redesign**: Modified geometry resulted in 30% stress reduction
- **Material Redistribution**: Removed material from low-stress areas and reinforced high-stress zones
- **Fillet Optimization**: Optimized fillet radii based on FEA results
- **Wall Thickness Variation**: Variable wall thickness based on local stress requirements

## Results Summary

The final design achieves:
- 25% weight reduction compared to traditional design
- 30% reduction in maximum stress
- 33% reduction in maximum deformation
- Improved dynamic response characteristics
