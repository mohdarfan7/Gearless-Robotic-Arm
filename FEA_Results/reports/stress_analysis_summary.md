# Stress Analysis Summary

## Overview
This report summarizes the results of static stress analysis performed on the gearless robotic arm design.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted using ANSYS Workbench with the following setup:
- Tetrahedral mesh with refinement in critical areas
- Fixed support at the base mounting points
- Applied loads representing 3x the expected operational load (for safety factor)
- Linear static structural analysis

## Results

### Maximum Stress
The maximum von Mises stress observed in the structure was 154.2 MPa, occurring at the junction between the upper arm and elbow joint. With the aluminum 6061-T6 material (yield strength 276 MPa), this provides a safety factor of 1.79.

### Critical Areas
1. **Elbow Joint Connection**: 154.2 MPa
2. **Base Rotation Mechanism**: 118.7 MPa
3. **Wrist Actuator Mount**: 92.3 MPa

### Deformation
Maximum deformation at full extension with 5 kg payload: 3.2 mm at the end effector.

## Comparison with Traditional Design
FEA comparison with equivalent traditional geared design:

| Metric | Traditional Design | Gearless Design | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Max Stress | 220.5 MPa | 154.2 MPa | 30.1% |
| Weight | 3.2 kg | 2.4 kg | 25.0% |
| Max Deformation | 4.8 mm | 3.2 mm | 33.3% |

## Design Modifications Based on FEA
1. Increased fillet radius at the elbow joint from 3mm to 5mm
2. Added 0.5mm wall thickness to the wrist actuator housing
3. Implemented internal ribbing structure in the upper arm segment

## Conclusion
The gearless design demonstrates significantly improved stress distribution while achieving a 25% weight reduction. All critical components maintain a safety factor above 1.75 under worst-case loading conditions.
