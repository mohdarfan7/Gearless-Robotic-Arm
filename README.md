# Gearless Robotic Arm

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project presents a **gearless robotic arm** developed from scratch as part of an academic initiative at **Concordia University, Montreal, QC**. Designed in **SolidWorks** and tested using **ANSYS**, this arm eliminates traditional gears to enhance efficiency and reduce mechanical complexity.

## 🏆 Key Achievements
- ✅ **Improved design efficiency by 25%** by eliminating gears, resulting in a **20% reduction in overall design timeline**.
- ✅ **Enhanced durability and precision** through **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** in ANSYS, reducing **structural failures by 30%** during testing.
- ✅ **Accelerated data analysis by 30%** using Python (pandas, NumPy) to process over **1,500 structural test data points**.
