| 25% load (0.75 kg) | 0.8 mm | 412 μstrain | None detected |
| 50% load (1.5 kg) | 1.7 mm | 824 μstrain | None detected |
| 75% load (2.25 kg) | 2.6 mm | 1240 μstrain | None detected |
| 100% load (3.0 kg) | 3.4 mm | 1650 μstrain | None detected |
| 125% load (3.75 kg) | 4.3 mm | 2075 μstrain | None detected |

The arm successfully maintained structural integrity throughout all loading conditions. Maximum deflection at full load was 3.4 mm, which is within the acceptable range for a lightweight arm of this class.

## Performance Measurements

### Positioning Accuracy and Repeatability

| Joint | Accuracy (Target Position vs. Actual) | Repeatability (Standard Deviation) |
|-------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Base rotation | ±0.32 mm | 0.12 mm |
| Shoulder | ±0.41 mm | 0.17 mm |
| Elbow | ±0.38 mm | 0.15 mm |
| Wrist | ±0.29 mm | 0.10 mm |
| End effector (combined) | ±0.48 mm | 0.22 mm |

The arm achieved an overall positioning accuracy of ±0.48 mm, exceeding the design target of ±0.5 mm. This represents a 60% improvement over traditional geared designs which typically achieve ±1.2 mm.

### Speed and Acceleration Testing

| Joint | Maximum Speed | Time for 90° Rotation | Maximum Acceleration |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Base rotation | 45°/sec | 2.0 sec | 120°/sec² |
| Shoulder | 40°/sec | 2.2 sec | 100°/sec² |
| Elbow | 42°/sec | 2.1 sec | 110°/sec² |
| Wrist | 50°/sec | 1.8 sec | 140°/sec² |

All joints met the design target of 90° rotation in under 2.5 seconds. The direct-drive system provides superior acceleration characteristics compared to geared alternatives.

### Power Efficiency Testing
